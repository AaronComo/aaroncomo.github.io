Hi there! My name is Weifeng Liu (AaronComo), an undergraduate student at [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn). I became a member of the Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing in 2022, where I am currently engaged in research focused on the field of DeepFake under the esteemed guidance of Professor [Run Wang](https://wangrun.github.io).

My research interest lies in the Security and Privacy of Artificial Intelligence, where I explore the vulerability and robustness of Deep Learning Models and Large Language Models (e.g., Adversarial Attack, DeepFake Detection). During my academic study, I enjoyed a wonderful time with [Tianyi She](https://ansonshe.github.io), Yan Cai and Boheng Li.
